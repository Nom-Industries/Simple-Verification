The filter list in `filter.txt` is a list of words that will be unable to show up in any Simple Verification filters. The list is based on [a report published by ofcom](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/225335/offensive-language-quick-reference-guide.pdf). All words in [the report](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/225335/offensive-language-quick-reference-guide.pdf), including mildly offensive words, have been added to prevent any offence. Variations of words in the report may also be included in the filter list.
